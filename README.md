# HouseholdUI and Taiwan Household Registration Database Project
- Project Name: Household Registration User Interface
- This project represents a significant step in preserving and understanding the rich demographic history of Taiwan, offering invaluable resources for researchers and historians worldwide.

## 1. Introduction
The Taiwan Household Registration Database Project is an innovative input interface designed to assist the Program of Historical Demography at the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, in compiling and organizing historical data. This project aims to establish a comprehensive database of Taiwan's household registration records, focusing on documents managed by the police since 1906.

### Key Features
- **Data Collection**: The project primarily collects individual household registration books, meticulously recording various demographic and social details of Taiwan's residents. These details include ethnicity, smallpox vaccination status, foot binding, opium use, and other vital statistics.
- **Dynamic Data**: In addition to basic information, the database encompasses dynamic data such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and migrations, offering a rich historical perspective of the Taiwanese population.
- **Resource Accessibility**: The Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, provides administrative support for data entry and has made the database accessible to researchers both in Taiwan and internationally. Currently, the database includes digitized field data from three regions: Zhubei, Emei, and Beipu in Hsinchu.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: For a detailed understanding of the household registration records and their historical context, refer to the "Household Registration Records Data Nature Q&A" by Yeh (2022), available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nui-RuWA3EDEWWCFa4iUd3f8xP2Ry1A7/view?usp=sharing).

## 2. Usage Instructions
To effectively use the Taiwan Household Registration Database Project's input interface, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download and Extract
- Download the interface package.
- Extract the files to a folder. The default folder name should be `housePlanInput_1`.

### Step 2: Install Node.js
- Install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
- Ensure that Node.js is properly installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running `node -v` in your command prompt or terminal, which should display the version of Node.js installed.

### Step 3: Launch the Interface
- Locate and double-click on the `use.bat` file in the `housePlanInput_1` folder.
- This action will automatically open your default web browser. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use Google Chrome.

### Step 4: Data Entry
- Once the interface is open in your browser, you can start entering data according to the provided fields.
- After entering the data and saving it, the interface will generate four different CSV files in the `housePlanInput_1` folder, corresponding to different data categories: `household`, `person`, `event`, and `feedback`.

### Step 5: Data Compilation and Analysis
- The generated CSV files (`household.csv`, `person.csv`, `event.csv`, and `feedback.csv`) can now be used for further compilation, merging, and analysis as per your research requirements.
